## Overview

This project forms part of [Kwanele Sabela](../team.html#kwanele-sabela)’s MSc Agric research and focuses on accurately assessing Sclerotinia head rot in sunflower. The work involves designing and validating a standard area diagram set to improve the consistency and reliability of disease severity ratings. Field surveys, image-based assessments and comparative scoring are used to evaluate how well the tool performs under real production conditions.

## Key questions

-   Can we develop a Sclerotinia head rot standard area diagram (SAD) that improves accuracy, reliability and rater agreement?
-   How can we measure sunflower head rot severity accurately and consistently across raters, environments and seasons?
-   What level of rater error (inter- and intra-rater) affects current visual assessments, and how much can a standard area diagram improve reliability?

## Outputs
