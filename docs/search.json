His research focuses on large-scale field disease surveillance across major sorghum-producing regions, with an emphasis on understanding disease distribution, incidence, and severity under different agro-ecological conditions. His work integrates field-based disease assessments, laboratory diagnostics, and molecular identification of fungal pathogens, alongside statistical and spatial data analysis. Through this approach, he aims to generate evidence that supports disease risk assessment, informs management strategies, and strengthens the translation of epidemiological research into practical tools for farmers and stakeholders.\nProject Title: Incidence, management and producer perceptions of fungal diseases in sorghum cropping systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariana van Deventer\nPhD Candidate | Stellenbosch University\nCo-supervisor\nStart: 2023\n\n\nMore about Mariana\n\nMariana van Deventer is a postgraduate student in the Plant Pathology Department at the University of Stellenbosch. Her research focuses on Sclerotinia stem rot development on canola and chemical control, with particular emphasis on Sclerotinia sclerotiorum epidemiology and disease risk prediction. She evaluates fungicide deposition and efficacy, monitors disease development in the field with molecular diagnostics, uses custom-made spore samplers to detect airborne spores, records micro- and macroclimate data from field locations in the Western Cape, and analyses the data using R software, aiming to develop a risk prediction model for canola stem rot, that would potentially equip local producers with a tool to enhance their decision-making process regarding economic fungicide application.\nProject Title: Modelling the risk of Sclerotinia stem rot of canola in the Western Cape of South Africa for improved chemical control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKwanele Sabela\nPhD Candidate | UFS\nStart: 2026\n\n\nMore about Kwanele\n\nKwanele Sabela is a Plant pathologist and newly doctoral candidate.
