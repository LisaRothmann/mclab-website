Our work centres on field pathology, epidemiology and practical disease management, supported by field trials, disease surveillance and data-driven interpretation. We aim to generate evidence that is relevant to producers, researchers and industry partners, and to communicate this knowledge in ways that support informed decision-making.\nOur research contributes to national efforts in several areas: understanding Sclerotinia diseases in oil and protein seed crops, advancing sorghum pathology, and maintaining ongoing disease surveillance in sorghum, soybean and sunflower systems. We are also gradually expanding into the human dimensions of plant pathology, including sociological and extension-focused work that helps connect scientific understanding with on-farm realities.\nWe are committed to cultivating the next generation of researchers by creating opportunities for students and early-career scientists to participate in fieldwork, engage with stakeholders and develop core skills in applied plant pathology.\nRead more about our background, vision and mission »"
