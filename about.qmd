## Our Group Background

The McLab Field Pathology & Epidemiology Group builds on a strong foundation established at the University of the Free State through many years of field-based, applied plant pathology. Earlier work, led by Prof Neal Wynne McLaren and collaborators, focused on crop diseases of national importance, statistical epidemiology and the development of field research capacity within South African cropping systems.

Building on this foundation, the group has grown into a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment working across crops, regions and research partners.

In recognition of the foundation established by Prof McLaren, and to honour the lasting impact of his work, the group carries the name *McLab* as a tribute to his legacy.

## The legacy of Prof McLaren

Prof McLaren joined the University of the Free State in 2005 to strengthen applied plant pathology and field-based epidemiology. With decades of experience at the ARC-Grain Crops Institute (ARC-GCI, Potchefstroom), he contributed significantly to sorghum and soybean pathology, statistical epidemiology and international crop disease collaborations, including through initiatives such as INTSORMIL.

His leadership helped position UFS as a hub for advanced epidemiology and postgraduate training in field pathology. Prof McLaren retired in 2018, leaving behind an impactful legacy of rigorous science, mentorship and national crop disease research.
